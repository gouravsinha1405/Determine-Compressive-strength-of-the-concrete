### Techniques used:

- Backward elimination method for feature selection
- Gaussian mixture model and K means for unsupervised clustering
- Variance Inflation Factor for feature engineering
- Transformers and pipelines
- Lasso, Ridge, Polynomial regression and xgboost with randomsearchcv

### Data Description:

The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled). The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations).

### Domain:
Cement manufacturing

### Context:

Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
